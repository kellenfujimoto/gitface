Concept:
- decentralized data model
-- emphasis on data integrity and privacy
--- data is cloned across multiple nodes
---- data wholly owned and stored by the users
--- data encrypted
---- key storage?
--- user's node source of truth
---- each user's posts seaparate repositories
- *nix file system heiarchy and security used to silo information and regulate discussion
-- private, limited, and public information shareable
--- private folder contents encrypted with PGP
---- read+write access to user, no others
--- limited folder contents encrypted with symetric encryption
---- read+write access to user, "commenters" group
--- public folder contents stored in cleartext
---- read access to all, write access to those in "commenters" group
-- users share information in the form of plain text files

Implimentation:
- syncing through Git
-- each user has their own repo
--- way of subscription?
---- cloning repo as way to subscribe, with read-only access unless user given permission by owner to write (comment)
--- authentication keys stored..?
---- "private" folder
----- single point of security failure for entire network
